Telling a story - Purpose of presenting vaccination figures -> it is the solution for the pandemic -> we want herd immunation - How close are we to herd ...

    - explain what herd immunation is
    - explain why we will always use ratios/percentages (can change later to totals as well) b/c of herd immun.
    - given value
    - 1 chart at a time - ordered by either alphabetically or by descending/asced order of vaccinations
        - 1 bar for the world
    - long horizontal chart
    - maps
        - 1 map for showing green or red (can be opening the map)
        - 1 map for density of vaccination admins / 100

- how can we bring breakdown by income into the pages
- how can we bring breakdown by age into the pages

Design by page

- Doses admin

  - Components:
    - Explanation (paragraphs)
    - green/red map (pick color blind friendly colors)
    - stacked barchart with herd immun line
    - density /100 map

- Vacc rate time series:

  - Components:
    - explanation about how they give estimates for when we will reach herd immun
    - time series chart
      1. vacc rate / 100 ppl
      2. % vaccination rate over time
    - can link both at the same time
    - can draw both lines at the same time so that it is eaiser to draw a line of best fit for
      future predictions of when we will reach herd immun percentage

- penalty for countries with a lot of doses

- three vars:

  - income
  - doses
  - donations

- Vacc distrib:

  - possible ideas:
    1. who needs the most help in terms of low income, high pop density and not many doses
    2. penalty for not donating enough, high income, high doses, low donations

- Age breakdown:
  - See which age groups need to be targetted more so that herd immunity is reached
  - Where should i go? young adults -> bars and nightlife stuff or teenagers -> schools
