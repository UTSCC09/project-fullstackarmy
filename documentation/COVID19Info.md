## COVID 19 INFO from JHU FAQ Website

### Herd Immunity and Protection

We are still learning whether or not the current Covid-19 vaccines prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is likely they reduce the risk of virus transmission but probably not completely in everyone. This is one of the reasons why it will still be important for people to continue wearing masks and practicing physical distancing, even after being vaccinated.

Until we substantially reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and see hospitalizations and deaths dramatically decrease, we still need to wear masks and practice physical distancing even after vaccination.

The vaccine is not 100% effective and we still do not know if someone who was vaccinated can develop asymptomatic infection and transmit the virus.

If a vaccine not only protects against disease but reduces transmission, and continues to do so for many years, we are likely to reach a state of herd protection when masks and physical distancing will no longer be required.

Herd protection is achieved when a sufficient proportion of the population is made non-infectious through vaccination or natural infection so that the likelihood of an infectious individual transmitting to a susceptible individual is very low.

### Vaccination Status

Given how connected the world in the modern age, it is important to monitor the global vaccination status due to the true herd immunity / protection can only be achieved when all the countries reach the herd immunity / protection level.

This gives rise to the question at which dose are we considered protected from COVID19?

Each dose taken increase the protection against the virus, therefore it is vital to take the highest number of recommended doses. As of today it is possible for some vaccines to be 3 doses. A first dose, a second dose and a booster.

Therefore we see the herd immunity / protection level at each dose.

Functionality: they all have a switch button to turn them into a binary heat map of whether a country is above the herd immunination / protection threshold or not; also have a switch button to change the polygons from country to continent only

### Vaccination Distribution

When considering the vaccination status of a country, it is important to monitor how much supply each country has to the vaccines. Since if there is low supply at that country, it will not be possible to distribute as many vaccines are possible.

This allows us to see which countries are have an under supply of vaccines, thus require more donations from countries that have an over supply of vaccines.

Functionality: binary heat map switch since there are some countries with an excess number of doses
