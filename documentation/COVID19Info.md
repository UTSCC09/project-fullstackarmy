### Herd Immunity and Protection

We are still learning how the current Covid-19 vaccines reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is likely they reduce the risk of virus transmission but probably not completely. Vaccines prime the body into a better position to fight off viruses. However, this does not mean a person cannot transmit the virus. It just means the period they are infectious is significantly reduced. The hope is that the period of infectivity is so low, it would significantly reduce the possibility of transmission, however, we still donâ€™t know how well the current vaccines can accomplish this. This is one of the reasons why it is still imperative for people to continue wearing masks and practice physical distancing, even if they are vaccinated.

Until we substantially reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and hospitalizations and death rates dramatically decrease, wearing masks and practicing physical distancing is required.

The vaccine is not 100% effective, and we still do not know if someone who is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 can develop asymptomatic infection and transmit the virus.

If a vaccine not only protects against disease but reduces transmission, and continues to do so for many years, we are likely to reach a state of herd protection when masks and physical distancing will no longer be required.

### Vaccination Status

Given how connected the world is in the modern age, it is important to monitor the global vaccination status because true herd immunity/protection can only be achieved when all the countries reach a herd immunity/protection level.

We must then wonder: at which dose are we considered protected from COVID19?

Each dose administered in the community increases survivability chances against the virus and reduces the likelihood of transmission, therefore it is vital to receive the full number of recommended doses. As of today, it is possible for some vaccines to be 3 doses. A first dose, a second dose and a booster.

Therefore, we view the herd immunity/protection level at each dose.

At a first dose level, 60% of the country out of 218 countries, that we have data on, have reached the herd immunity / protection threshold. A full list of countries can be downloaded here.
At a second dose level, 50% of the country out of 218 countries, that we have data on, have reached the herd immunity / protection threshold. A full list of countries can be downloaded here.
At a third dose level, 30% of the country out of 218 countries, that we have data on, have reached the herd immunity / protection threshold. A full list of countries can be downloaded here.

### Vaccination Rates

To estimate when a country will reach herd immunity/protection level, we can learn and extrapolate from the past vaccination rates. There are many factors that could affect the vaccination rate such as vaccination supply, and so a simple average of the last month's vaccination rate is used to predict how long it will take for each country to reach the herd immunity/protection threshold.

For example, Canada's rate of vaccination last month was 3%. This means that every month, an additional 3% of the population is vaccinated. Given that the current percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated is 78%, this means that at the current rate, it will take 2 months and a half for Canada's entire population to be fully vaccinated.

### Vaccination Distribution

When considering the vaccination status of a country, it is important to monitor how much supply each country has to the vaccines. If there is a low supply in that country, it will not be possible to distribute as many vaccines as possible to quickly reach herd immunity.

When looking at facts and figures about countries, specifically, about number of vaccine doses. It is important to look at percentages instead of raw values. For example, if a country has a very high population count, that means it will need a very high number of vaccines doses. This means comparing the number vaccine doeses with another country that has a low population count is pointless since it's guaranteed to be lower! Instead we look at a simple percentage:
number of doses / number of doses required to reach 85% of the population.

This allows us to see which countries are have an under supply of vaccines, thus require more donations from countries that have an over supply of vaccines.

The delivered doses that each country has at the moment, about % of the countries have enough doses to fully vaccinate the country's and additional booster shots, % have enough doses to reach herd immunity / protection, while % of countries don't have sufficient doses to reach the threshold.
