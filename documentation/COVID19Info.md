### Herd Immunity and Protection

We are still learning how the current Covid-19 vaccines reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is likely they reduce the risk of virus transmission but probably not completely. Vaccines prime the body into a better position to fight off viruses. However, this does not mean a person cannot transmit the virus. It just means the period they are infectious is significantly reduced. The hope is that the period of infectivity is so low, it would significantly reduce possibility of transmission, however we still donâ€™t know how well the current vaccines can accomplish this. This is one of the reasons why it is still imperative for people to continue wearing masks and practice physical distancing, even if they are vaccinated.

Until we substantially reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and hospitalizations and death rates dramatically decrease, we still need to wear masks and practice physical distancing.

The vaccine is not 100% effective and we still do not know if someone who is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 can develop asymptomatic infection and transmit the virus.

If a vaccine not only protects against disease but reduces transmission, and continues to do so for many years, we are likely to reach a state of herd protection when masks and physical distancing will no longer be required.

### Vaccination Status

Given how connected the world in the modern age, it is important to monitor the global vaccination status due to the true herd immunity / protection can only be achieved when all the countries reach the herd immunity / protection level.

This gives rise to the question at which dose are we considered protected from COVID19?

Each dose taken increase the protection against the virus, therefore it is vital to take the highest number of recommended doses. As of today it is possible for some vaccines to be 3 doses. A first dose, a second dose and a booster.

Therefore we see the herd immunity / protection level at each dose.

Functionality: they all have a switch button to turn them into a binary heat map of whether a country is above the herd immunination / protection threshold or not; also have a switch button to change the polygons from country to continent only

### Vaccination Distribution

When considering the vaccination status of a country, it is important to monitor how much supply each country has to the vaccines. Since if there is low supply at that country, it will not be possible to distribute as many vaccines are possible.

When looking at facts and figures about countries, specifically, about number of vaccine doses. It is important to look at percentages instead of raw values. For example, if a country has a very high population count, that means it will need a very high number of vaccines doses. This means comparing the number vaccine doeses with another country that has a low population count is pointless since it's guaranteed to be lower! Instead we look at a simple percentage:
number of doses / number of doses required to reach 85% of the population.

This allows us to see which countries are have an under supply of vaccines, thus require more donations from countries that have an over supply of vaccines.
